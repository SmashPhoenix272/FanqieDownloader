# Current Task: Improve Caching System and Performance

## Task Overview
We have successfully implemented the following improvements to the Fanqie Novel Downloader:

1. Separated novel info and chapters into different tables in the SQLite database for better data management.
2. Implemented individual files for chapter caching to improve performance for large novels.
3. Added metadata (last_updated timestamp) to the cache for better tracking and management.

## Completed Steps
1. Modified `cache.py` to implement the new caching structure.
2. Updated `fanqie_downloader.py` to work with the new cache structure.
3. Updated `README.md` to reflect the changes and new features.

## Next Steps
1. Test the new caching system thoroughly with various novels, especially large ones.
2. Monitor performance improvements and gather metrics.
3. Consider implementing a cache cleanup mechanism to manage disk space for long-term use.
4. Explore options for parallel downloading of chapters to further improve performance.

## Context
The improved caching system should provide better performance and manageability for the Fanqie Novel Downloader. The separation of novel info and chapters, along with individual files for chapter content, allows for more efficient data retrieval and storage, especially for large novels. The added metadata will help in tracking the freshness of the cached data and could be used for implementing cache invalidation strategies in the future.
