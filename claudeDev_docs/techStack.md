# Fanqie Novel Downloader Technology Stack

## Programming Language
- Python 3.7+

## Dependencies
- requests: For making HTTP requests to the Fanqie Novel API
- python-dotenv: For managing environment variables
- tqdm: For displaying progress bars

## Database
- SQLite: Lightweight, serverless database for caching novel information and chapter metadata

## File System
- Individual text files for storing chapter content

## Architecture Decisions

1. Caching System
   - Decision: Use SQLite for storing novel information and chapter metadata, with individual files for chapter content
   - Rationale: This hybrid approach provides a good balance between performance and simplicity. SQLite offers efficient querying for metadata, while individual files allow for easy management of large amounts of text data.

2. Separation of Concerns
   - Decision: Split the caching functionality (cache.py) from the main downloader logic (fanqie_downloader.py)
   - Rationale: This separation improves code organization, maintainability, and allows for easier future enhancements to either component.

3. Environment Variables
   - Decision: Use .env file for storing sensitive information like API URLs
   - Rationale: This approach enhances security and flexibility, allowing for easy configuration changes without modifying the code.

4. Progress Tracking
   - Decision: Use tqdm for displaying download progress
   - Rationale: Provides a user-friendly way to visualize the download progress, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. Error Handling and Retries
   - Decision: Implement a retry mechanism for handling invalid chapter content
   - Rationale: Improves reliability by attempting to recover from temporary failures or invalid data.

6. Modular Design
   - Decision: Organize code into separate functions and classes
   - Rationale: Enhances readability, maintainability, and allows for easier unit testing and future expansions.

## Future Considerations

1. Asynchronous Programming
   - Potential Decision: Implement asynchronous downloads using asyncio and aiohttp
   - Rationale: Could significantly improve download speeds for large novels by allowing concurrent chapter downloads

2. GUI Framework
   - Potential Decision: Implement a graphical user interface using a framework like PyQt or Tkinter
   - Rationale: Would provide a more user-friendly interface for less technical users

3. Output Formats
   - Potential Decision: Implement support for generating EPUB or PDF files
   - Rationale: Would provide more flexible output options for users with different reading preferences or devices

4. Containerization
   - Potential Decision: Dockerize the application
   - Rationale: Would simplify deployment and ensure consistent environments across different systems
